// NewHandler builds the complete HTTP handler: the route table wrapped in the
// middleware chain.
//
// It is exported and listener-free so the whole request path can be exercised
// with httptest, and so cmd wiring can construct a handler without committing
// to a socket. A nil logger is replaced with a discarding one rather than
// panicking — losing logs must never be the reason a request fails.
//
// Routing uses the stdlib method-aware ServeMux patterns (Go 1.22+); no
// third-party router is pulled in for two health routes.

	// panicking handler, which would otherwise be the one response that escapes
	// without the policy.
